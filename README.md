# Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption

## Overview

This project implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a simple and widely known encryption technique. The program can encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift-based substitution method. It is ideal for understanding the basics of cryptographic principles and secure communication.

## Features

- Encrypt messages by shifting characters based on a key.
- Decrypt messages back to their original form using the same key.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- User-friendly CLI interface for input and output.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
